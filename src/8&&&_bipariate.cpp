/*
validate bipariate graph
Input friend's relation {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}}, could you split all the users into two groups and for the user in each group, 
all the users do not know each other. So the expected output should be group1 {1, 3}, group2 {2, 4}. 
If it can't be splitted into two groups, just return "impossible".
